# Barneys

Consulting on a [custom sculpture for Barneys](http://instagram.com/p/g8L4uaOBYH), the 2013 Winter windows. Built with [three.js](http://threejs.org/). With art direction from [Joanie Lemercier](http://tumblr.joanielemercier.com/), produced by Julia Kaganskiy.

This repository also contains unused sketches in Rhino Python for a piece inside the store.
